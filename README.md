# Real Time Bus Tracker
This project file demonstrates a project where we needed to pull together live bus location data.  Pressing the button will show a bus route located in my city. 

# Useage
Cloning the repo and opening the index.html file in a browser or in VS code with the Live Server extension will run the program. 

Future versions of this app will display live data in text fields to the left or right. There will also be more UI to be added which is currently TBD.

# Roadmap
Future considerations for this project would be to add other active bus schedules to the map, and a list of bus routes with the ability to activate each one to show all possible bus routes within my city.
